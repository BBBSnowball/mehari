You are reading our blog. Good. So I should better tell you what this is all about. Sebastian and I are working on our master theses and we are writing a blog along the way. That way, we can publish some information early and often - and it is a good opportunity to practise our English writing skills.

I guess now you wonder what the topic of our theses is. Sorry, you have to wait for our next posts. This time, I'm writing about a more mundane topic: We need some blog engine.

When I asked some friends, they said: "That's easy - don't write a blog." Well, I'm doing this for my master thesis. Then they suggested HTML and vi. Not so helpful...

So how can we find a good way to write a blog? Well, obviously there is Wordpress. I was suprised that even a lot of techical blogs use it. However, it grew into much more than a simple blog engine, so this is not what I was looking for.

During my search, I looked at the source of lot of blogs to find out what they are using. Wikipedia lists software that is used by top 20 blogs (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_software#Software_used_by_top_20_blogs)) - mostly Wordpress. I like [Movable type](http://www.movabletype.com/blog.html), but it costs too much money.

Another intersting one is Blogger because it was funded by Y Combinator. I really love Paul Graham's books about Lisp. He certainly is a smart guy. So I figured that a project that is supported by his company is worth a look. Well, they've been bought by Google and the site is closed. That certainly was an interesting thing, if Google was so interested in it ;-)

Finally, I found [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). It doesn't have any bells and whistles that we don't need. Even better, it uses Markdown for the posts. I'm using Markdown a lot - for personal notes, for notes in lectures, when I'm writing for the [lessproject wiki](http://lessproject.de/). I don't have to tell you that I immediately liked Ghost. After some struggles with the Node package manager ([solution is here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18428563)), I have the blog up and running.

One of those "bells and whistles" that Ghost does not have (yet) is multi-user support. This means that Sebstian and I will be using the same user account. We will add a signature at the end of each post. Feel free to remind us, if we forget to do that.

We will try Ghost for a few weeks. If you think "That totally looks like Wordpress", it might be. Look at the bottom of this page. If it doesn't say "Proudly published with Ghost", it probably is a Wordpress blog ;-)
